       <p class="1"> Although I received a degree in the Liberal Arts, I am interested in a career in tech because I find this type of work fascinating and believe it would well suited to my aptitudes. I particularly like completing work that involves solving logical puzzles, so coding feels right up my alley. I am interested in UX design as well, particularly because it would involve utilizing my creativity and aptitude for analysis and design. I enjoy work that helps others, + I have both a keen eye and knack for detail.
